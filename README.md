# Counterfactual-Fairness-with-Partially-Known-Causal-Graph
 
To reproduce results on synthetic datasets:
    Just run the file run.sh in the working directory.
    
    Examples and more explanations on commands in run.sh:
        1. 'python data_generator.py $j $((2*j))' to generate the observational and counterfactual data for the setting (j)Node(2*j)Edge;
        2. 'Rscript main.R $j $((2*j)) $i' to fit the models using the data generated by the i_th causal graph in the setting (j)Node(2*j)Edge;
        3. 'Rscript Simu_results_filter_and_processor.R' to obtain Table 1. Numeric results for RMSE and Unfairness.
        4. 'Rscript Simu_filtered_Boxplot.R' to obtain Figure 1. Boxplot for RMSE and Unfairness.
        5. The resulting tables and boxplots can be found in the folder 'Repository'.

To reproduce results on real datasets:
        Run 'Rscript main_RealData_RMSE_and_Unfairness.R' to obtain Table 2.
        Run 'Rscript main_RealData_Density_plots.R' to obtain Figure 9.
